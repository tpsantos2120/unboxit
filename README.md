# User Experience Design - UX

## Project Goal

This is **UNBOXIT** a website where it allows you to search for Movies and TV Series to add to a watchlist where you can use as a tracker, and once you have watched you can tick off your list. It also comes with Recommendations and Trending in the cinematography world, you will be able to watch trailers and also know more trivial information about your favourite Movies and TV Series. In addition, I will use IMDB endpoint from Rapid API to consume their huge database of Movies and TV Series.
